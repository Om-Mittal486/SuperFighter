 SupeRPG (Super RPG) is a 2D Unity game with elements of turn-based RPG.
  - Made in Unity Engine.
  - Turn-based RPG system (player moves first, then enemy, then player, etc.).
  - High-performant and responsive UI screens made with new UI Toolkit.
  - Randomized battle and shop systems (every playthrough is unique).
  - Campaign consisting of 20+ battles with scaling enemies and different difficulties.
  - All assets and sprites are custom and hand-made; all game data is layed out in CSV format, allowing it to be easily edited.

repository, open it with Unity Editor (version at least 2022.3.51f1) and build the game from there.
